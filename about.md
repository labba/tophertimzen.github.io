I am currently studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Security and Information Assurance at Southern Oregon University. With a graduation date of June 2015, I am currently working on finishing the final year of my undergrad. In the Spring I will be assisting in teaching Windows internals and memory forensics using the Volatility framework.

My research emphasis has been on reverse engineering, malware, exploitation development, incident response and live memory hacking. I also have had exposure to Linux and Windows system administration, networking, flow data analysis, cryptography and security design principles. Furthermore, I have had two successful internships in industy, one focused on systems administration and the other on cyber operations. 

Outside of working on research or course material I enjoy hiking, playing guitar and discovering new music.
