###DEF CON 23 - Hijacking Arbitrary .NET Application Control Flow

- This speech will demonstrate attacking .NET applications at runtime. I will show how to modify running applications with advanced .NET and assembly level attacks that alter the control flow of any .NET application. New attack techniques and tools will be released to allow penetration testers and attackers to carry out advanced post exploitation attacks.

- This presentation gives an overview of how to use these tools in a real attack sequence and gives a view into the .NET hacker space.
