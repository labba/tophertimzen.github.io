I was debating on whether or not I wanted to do a blog entry on my failed yet successful attempt at the FLARE On challenge (I only completed up to binary #10) and am still thinking it over. However, I am reading write ups and I see that my approach to #7 is a lot easier than most and I wanted to share it. Needless to say if you know me or my work, I was very excited this was a .NET binary! 

The binary "YUSoMeta.exe" presents a nice message for us

I decided to throw the binary into one of my favorite .NET tools, [Gray Wolf](http://www.digitalbodyguard.com/graywolf.html), which also does deobfuscation! 

Throwing the binary in without deobfuscating reveals it is obfuscated..

So go and be rid of that!

Now looking at all of the source code I came across the main method that does the decryption of our key in System.Void ns0.Class1::Main(System.String[])

(code cut for brevity) 

{% highlight c# %}

	Console.WriteLine(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes));
	Console.Write(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes2));
	string text = Console.ReadLine().Trim();
	string b = Class1.smethod_0(class2_, byte_2) + '_' + Class1.smethod_3();
	if (text == b)
	{
		Console.WriteLine(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes4));
		Console.Write(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes5));
		Console.WriteLine(Class1.smethod_1(text, byte_));
		return;
	}
	Console.WriteLine(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes3));
}

{% endhighlight %}

So it needs us to input some string value and if it matches b it will decrypt our key. Notice the 3rd WriteLine is taking text and putting it through another routine with byte_. I thought this was the key and instantly traced Class1.smethod_1. 

{% highlight c# %}

byte[] bytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(string_0, byte_0.Length)
{
	Salt = byte_0
}.GetBytes(32);
rijndaelManaged.IV = new byte[16];
rijndaelManaged.Key = bytes;
[SNIP]

{% endhighlight %}

and saw it was doing crypto.. boring. 

I then noticed Class1.smethod_0 was generating the "b" string which is compared to our string so I traced smethod_0. 

{% highlight c# %}

static string smethod_0(Class2 class2_0, byte[] byte_0)
{
	byte[] array = Class1.smethod_2();
	string text = "";
	for (int i = 0; i < byte_0.Length; i++)
	{
		text += (char)(byte_0[i] ^ array[i % array.Length]);
	}
	return text;
}

{% endhighlight %}

and our look now we need an smethod_2 to see what this loop does

{% highlight c# %}

static byte[] smethod_2()
{
	return Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().ManifestModule.ResolveMethod(100663297).GetMethodBody().GetILAsByteArray();
}

{% endhighlight %}

Ah! It is looking at some runtime information which is why it cannot be edited! 

The line making string b also called into smethod_3() which also uses runtime information in the form of GetExecutingAssembly(). 

{% highlight c# %}

static string smethod_3()
{
	StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
	MD5 mD = MD5.Create();
	foreach (CustomAttributeData current in CustomAttributeData.GetCustomAttributes(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()))
	{
		stringBuilder.Append(current.ToString());
	}
	byte[] bytes = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(stringBuilder.ToString());
	byte[] value = mD.ComputeHash(bytes);
	return BitConverter.ToString(value).Replace("-", "");
}

{% endhighlight %}

Well, this was all I needed and I started copy/pasting the logic into my own C# project.

Note that we need runtime information to perform smethod_2 and smethod_3... I just used reflection to load the binary in my project!

{% highlight c# %}

static byte[] smethod_2()
    {
        Assembly asm = System.Reflection.Assembly.Load(System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes("YUSoMeta.exe"));
        return asm.ManifestModule.ResolveMethod(100663297).GetMethodBody().GetILAsByteArray();
    }

{% endhighlight %}

and performed the same conversion for smethod_3()

{% highlight c# %}

static string smethod_3()
{
    StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    MD5 mD = MD5.Create();
    Assembly asm = System.Reflection.Assembly.Load(System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes("YUSoMeta.exe"));
    foreach (CustomAttributeData current in CustomAttributeData.GetCustomAttributes(asm))
    {
        stringBuilder.Append(current.ToString());
    }
    byte[] bytes = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(stringBuilder.ToString());
    byte[] value = mD.ComputeHash(bytes);
    return BitConverter.ToString(value).Replace("-", "");
}

{% endhighlight %}

Doing this and copying all of the other needed information reveals my new main() without any checking because I have all of the needed information already using reflection!

{% highlight c# %}

void mainRoutine()
{
    Console.WriteLine(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes));
    Console.Write(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes2));
    string b = smethod_0(byte_2) + '_' + smethod_3();
    Console.WriteLine(b);
    Console.WriteLine(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes4));
    Console.Write(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes5));
    Console.WriteLine(smethod_1(b, byte_));
    Console.WriteLine(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes3));
}

{% endhighlight %}

Notice in the main I also replaced the call to smethod_1 with "b" instead of "text", which is no longer in mine! 

Running this reveals the magic (and yes, I like to tamper so I left the last WriteLine which is the failed attempt)

and not only read the source, but changed it! 

Time permitting I hope to write the steps I took to solve the challenges I did! Like I said, while I may not have been "successful" at winning, I learned an awful lot from participating in FLARE ON!
