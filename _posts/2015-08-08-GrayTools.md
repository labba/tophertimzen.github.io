It is with great pleasure that I open source all materials for my DEF CON 23 talk "Hijacking Arbitrary .NET Application Control Flow". The github repo for all code is located [https://github.com/GrayKernel](https://github.com/GrayKernel "here").

For those interested, there are two white papers associated with these tools that I submitted with my talk. They are

- [Acquiring .NET Objects From the Managed Heap](/resources/grayStorm/AcquiringDotNetObjectsFromTheManagedHeap.pdf)
- [Hijacking Arbitrary .NET Application Control Flow](/resources/grayStorm/HijackingArbitraryDotnetApplicationControlFlow.pdf)

There are also some associated blog entries on these tools on my blog.

If you want to reach out, don't hesitate! 

Cheers
